# SUPERALPHA
This documentation needs a lot of improvement and validation. Please don't use this unless you know what you're doing for now! It's highly experimental in **multiple ways**. It is intended to follow roughly the flow of the original NetBox documentation, and the tooling and software chosen is supposed to match the Linux way as closely as possible.
