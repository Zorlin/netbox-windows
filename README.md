# netbox-windows
This repository contains a guide for building and running NetBox on Windows. It is a work in progress; please submit a bug report for any issues you encounter.

# SUPERALPHA
This documentation needs a lot of improvement and validation. Please don't use this unless you know what you're doing for now! It's highly experimental in **multiple ways**. It is intended to follow roughly the flow of the original NetBox documentation, and the tooling and software chosen is supposed to match the Linux way as closely as possible.

# Why not Bash on Windows?
Various reasons. I would like to eventually explore Bash on Windows and maybe port this to it, but Bash/Ubuntu on Windows is not avaiable for Windows 7 and is thus not as flexible.
