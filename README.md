# netbox-windows
This repository contains a guide for building and running NetBox on Windows. It is a work in progress; please submit a bug report for any issues you encounter.

# SUPERALPHA
This documentation needs a lot of improvement and validation. Please don't use this unless you know what you're doing for now! It's highly experimental in **multiple ways**. It is intended to follow roughly the flow of the original NetBox documentation, and the tooling and software chosen is supposed to match the Linux way as closely as possible.

Please also note that this is based on the latest version of python2 and has NOT been tested properly on python3. Use at your own risk!

# Why not Bash on Windows?
Various reasons. I would like to eventually explore Bash on Windows and maybe port this to it, but Bash/Ubuntu on Windows is not available for Windows 7 and is thus not as flexible.
